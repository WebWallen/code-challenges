Preserving code challenges from the freeCodeCamp Data Structures &amp; Algorithms Certification.

To be honest, this exists for the sole purpose of keeping GitHub green as I'm working on a project that has no need for a repo. 

So if you want to see what I'm *actually* building (and/or are a fan of dogs and cats, of which there are MANY adorable pictures), visit:

Guess what else doesn't have a repo? My portfolio website (there's an old one, but it stopped accepting changes for some unknown reason).

So now I just deploy the changes straight to the live site via Zeit because this isn't an "urgent" or "highly important" issue.

Add a third website to the list of code with no repos (am I breaking some rule here? -- I promise I'm a lot more productive than GitHub makes it look).

Dogfather Digital is a web design and online marketing agency for premium pet product and service providers. 

Every last aspect of this website and others were handled by me alone (including logo design, etc).
